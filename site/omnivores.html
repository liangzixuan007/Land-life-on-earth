      <h2>Raccoon</h2>
      <h5>All About Raccoon</h5>
      <div class="fakeimg" style="height:300px;"><h5>Raccoons are agile and curious creatures primarily found in North America. They are known for their distinctive black "mask" around their eyes and the black rings that encircle their tails. Raccoons have thick gray fur and dexterous front paws, making them excellent climbers and artisans. Their diet is incredibly diverse, including fruits, plants, small mammals, birds, and crustaceans. In urban environments, raccoons are often seen as "thieves" of garbage cans, using their cunning intellect to scavenge for food. Raccoons are adaptable and fascinating animals, showcasing impressive survival skills and ingenuity in human environments.<h5></div>
      <p id = "title-of-extra">Nocturnal Creatures</p>
      <p id = "extra">Raccoons are primarily nocturnal, meaning they are most active at night. They have excellent night vision and rely on their keen sense of smell and touch to navigate and find food in the dark.<br>

      <h2>Bear</h2>
      <h5>All About Bear</h5>
      <div class="fakeimg" style="height:230px;"><h5>Bears, remarkable for their formidable size and strength coupled with their varied omnivorous diet and adaptability to diverse ecosystems worldwide, including those facing extreme conditions like the Arctic, exhibit complex behaviors such as hibernation during winter months to conserve energy, yet they confront persistent threats to their survival such as habitat destruction, illegal poaching, and escalating human-bear conflicts over resources and territory.<h5></div>

      <p id = "title-of-extra">Hibernation</p>
      <p id = "extra">Bears, during hibernation, undergo physiological changes, accumulate fat reserves, carefully select dens, and evolve adaptations; their hibernation duration varies based on environmental factors, lasting typically from several weeks to several months, playing a crucial ecological role, while human interaction can disrupt their hibernation patterns, ultimately impacting their survival and ecosystem health.</p><br>

      <h2>Badgers</h2>
      <h5>All About Badgers</h5>
      <div class="fakeimg" style="height:260px;"><h5>a hardy creature of the night, easily recognizable by its distinctive black-and-white face. From rugged woodlands to open plains, badgers carve out their existence, relying on their sharp claws for burrowing and their diverse diet for sustenance. Though often solitary, these resilient mammals play a crucial role in shaping their habitats, their presence echoing through the interconnected threads of the natural world. Badgers are part of the Mustelidae family, known for their robust build and short, powerful legs, ideal for digging, and they have a nocturnal, solitary nature, often engaging in mutual grooming and play behaviors with other members of their social group, strengthening bonds within the family unit.</h5></div>

      <p id = "title-of-extra"> More</p>
      <p id = "extra">Badgers have a specialized diet and hunting technique when it comes to dealing with social insects like bees and wasps; they use their powerful forelimbs to break open insect nests and consume the larvae inside, avoiding the stings of the adult insects.</p>

      <h2>Squirrel</h2>
      <h5>All About Squirrel</h5>
      <div class="fakeimg" style="height:320px;"><h5>Squirrels are small to medium-sized rodents known for their bushy tails, agility, and ability to climb trees with ease. With over 200 species found worldwide, squirrels inhabit diverse habitats, from forests and urban parks to suburban backyards, where they play important roles in ecosystems as seed dispersers and are prey for predators like hawks and snakes. Squirrels are renowned for their exceptional memory, especially in storing food for later. Through a strategy called caching, they bury nuts and seeds in various locations, often hiding hundreds or even thousands of them, relying on their spatial memory to retrieve them months later, contributing to their survival and forest regeneration.</h5></div>

      <p id = "title-of-extra"> More</p>
      <p id = "extra">Squirrels are excellent problem solvers and have been observed using deceptive tactics to protect their food. Some squirrels will pretend to bury nuts in one location while actually hiding them elsewhere, potentially fooling other animals or even forgetful squirrels from finding their stash.</p>

      <h2>Hedgehogs</h2>
      <h5>All About Hedgehogs</h5>
      <div class="fakeimg" style="height:230px;"><h5>Hedgehogs are fascinating creatures with a repertoire of behaviors that include not only their iconic defensive curl but also adorable antics like nose-twitching and exploring their surroundings with curiosity. Despite their somewhat prickly appearance, hedgehogs are beloved by many for their gentle nature and endearing demeanor, making them popular pets in some regions. Additionally, hedgehogs play important roles in ecosystems by controlling insect populations and aiding in seed dispersal through their foraging habits, highlighting their significance beyond their charming exterior.</h5></div>

      <p id = "title-of-extra">Self-Anointing</p>
      <p id = "extra">Hedgehogs exhibit a behavior called "self-anointing" where they lick or chew on new or strong-smelling objects and then spread the frothy saliva over their quills. The exact reason for this behavior is still not fully understood, but it's believed to be a form of scent-marking or defense mechanism.</p>
